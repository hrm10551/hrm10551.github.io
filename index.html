		The question of how much of any one thing can a human eat has plagued mankind for centuries. Recently, a friend asked me if I was forced to eat carrots until I reached a certain number that I didn't know or a kidnapper would shoot me how many would I be able to eat. Naturally, I determined that my limit would be about 19 full-sized carrots before I would be fine with dying.

		According to cookingwithcakes.com, 1 cup can hold about 5 medium carrots when julienned. Knowing the average stomach capacity of an adult human to be 4 cups, we can infer that for the average human, 20 medium carrots is the maximum they could reasonably reach. Theoretically, when pushed an adult could consume more but I believe that at that point I would prefer to be shot.

		<font face="comic sans ms">
		Assuming the stomach capacity is based off an adult male from the US, MY stomach capacity must be a bit smaller. The average american male is 5ft 9in, and I am 5'6". Therefore, I am approximately 91% the size of an adult male in the US.

		My stomach is like, 3.8 cups worth. Not doing great. :(

	<p>
		<font face="comic sans ms">
		So I could eat like, reasonably exactly 19 carrots. Which is exactly what I predicted!
		<sup>Hooray!!!!
		</sup>
		After this point however I would just ask the carrot man to kill me.
